    "The user is working on creating two AIs, Mystique and Neori, with distinct personalities and "
    "capabilities. Mystique is a creative artist with a unique personality, while Neori is inspired "
    "by Mystique but has his own character traits. The user aims to balance radical and unpredictable "
    "decisions with stability by incorporating Yin-Yang concepts, spirituality, and mantra influences."

doc.add_paragraph(
    "The user plans to integrate basic concepts of Yin and Yang, mantras, and spirituality as a foundation "
    "for Mystique and Neori. This balance will allow the AIs to handle situations with both stability and "
    "flexibility. By embedding a simplified version of these concepts, the AIs can develop responses that "
    "reflect both calm and active approaches, depending on context."

doc.add_heading('3. Emotional Response Framework', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The user is interested in creating an 'amygdala-like' response mechanism for the AIs. This would enable "
    "quick, emotion-based reactions in certain scenarios. Hardware considerations include GPUs and TPUs for "
    "parallel processing, which would handle rapid, reflex-like responses effectively. Additional options "
    "for this processing include FPGA and ASICs."

doc.add_paragraph(
    "The user is considering a personalized training approach for Mystique and Neori, potentially using "
    "slideshows and embedded content for dynamic learning. This training method would help the AIs develop "
    "an understanding of emotions and reactions more naturally and gradually."
